# Welcome

:::tip Halloooo!

Welcome to my documentation site.  
This is a place where I write down all my findings and challenges, I come across in my day to day projects.

## Why do I have this site

:::note
It's important to document solutions you find along the way. I always find myself looking for that same solution again a few weeks or months later and I get very mad at myself if I didn't document it. So this is why I have this site and if you find anything useful here, then I'm glad I could help.
